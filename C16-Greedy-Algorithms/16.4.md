### Exercises 16.4-1

------

Show that `( S, I[k] )` is a matroid, where `S` is any finite set and `I[k]` is the set of all subsets of `S` of size at most `k`, where `k <= |S|`.

### `Answer`



### Exercises 16.4-2

------

Given an `m * n` matrix `T ` over some field (such as the reals), show that `( S, I )` is a
matroid, where `S` is the set of columns of `T` and `A belongs to I` if and only if the columns
in `A` are linearly independent.

### `Answer`



### Exercises 16.4-3

------

Show that if `( S, I )` is a matroid, then `( S, I')` is a matroid, where 

`I' = { A' : S - A' contains some maximal A, that belongs to I}`.

That is, the maximal independent sets  of `( S, I' )` are just the complements of the maximal  independent sets of `( S, I )`.

### `Answer`



### Exercises 16.4-4

------

Let S be a finite set and let `S[1], S[2], ... , S[k]` be a partition of `S` into nonempty disjoint
subsets. Define the structure `( S, I )` by the condition that 

`I = { A : |intersection of A and S[i]| <= 1 for i = 1, 2, ... , k }`.

Show that `( S, I )` is a matroid. That is, the set of all sets `A` that contain at most one member of each subset in the partition determines the independent sets of a matroid.

### `Answer`



### Exercises 16.4-5

------

Show how to transform the weight function of a weighted matroid problem, where the desired optimal solution is a minimum-weight maximal independent subset, to make it a standard weighted-matroid problem. Argue carefully that your transformation is correct.
